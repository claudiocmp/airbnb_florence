# Florence Airbnb

Research on earnings' drivers for AirBNB-listed properties in Florence, Italy (until 2019). You can find [https://medium.com/@claudiocampanile_51180/which-airbnb-flat-types-should-i-let-in-florence-italy-1b92a9a99506](here the final report). The project follows the guidelines CRISP-DM.

We want to investigate how we could invest capital into a flat to rent for turists. To do so, we want to try to answer the following points:
* Understand Airbnb businesses in Florence: popular areas and highest occupancy, and mostly consolidated vs new listings over time.
* Relate the listing offer to our business orientation goal: listings are of any types, whereas we are interested in exploring small-to-medium-sized flats
* Investigate the characteristics of flats in relation to prices (how many guests can accept, utilities etc.)
