# Florence Airbnb

The scope of this project is to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas, in the City of Florence, Tuscany. The project follows the guidelines CRISP-DM.

We want to investigate how we could invest capital into a flat to rent for turists. To do so, we want to try to answer the following points:

  * Which areas of Florence are more popular, bringing highest occupancy. Also, which listings are more consolidated per area, and which are the areas where new listings are appearing

  * Investigate the caracteristics of flats in relation to returns (how many guests can accept, utilities etc.) for the consolidated activities

  * How earnings are distributed along the year, causing fluctuation of returns

# Summary

The process is executed in a Jupyter Notebook, where you can find:

* Data preparation. Data is taken from [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html](here, file: listings.csv.gz. Date 22 June 2019). Missing values and feature selection is processed to simplify the dataset and run an exploratory experiment.
* Data analysis. Prices and 
* Data modelling
* Data visualization
    
# Installation

The Notebook requires Python 3.7 installed on your machine to run. Dependencies are include in the Anaconda environment file `requirements.yml`
